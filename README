The stochgame module provides tools for working with two player stochastic games.  Most
important are the class StochGame for representing such games and the function
policy_iteration, which solves two player zero-sum stochastic games with discounted
payoffs (using a policy iteration algorithm due to Raghavan and Syed) or average payoffs
(using a policy iteration algorithm due to Bourque and Raghavan).
